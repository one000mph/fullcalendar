### Overview
This is a single-page calendar integration that works with FullCalendar and the Node.js
Google API.

### Usage

```
node server.js
```
Note: Must run `npm i` to install dependencies before continuing development on a
cloned repo or hosting on a server.

Access via `localhost:8000`

### Limitations
* Currently only allows one calendar to be displayed at a time.

### Future Work
* Allow users to add multiple calendars and toggle on/off
* Create events and persist to Google Calendar
* Real-time event push from Google Calendar to this page
